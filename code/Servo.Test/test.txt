The project is written in Python
To control the Servos we are using the "pigpio" library
The "pigpio" uses BCP pin numbering

1. Test the Servo range
    First you have to find out the range of the pulse time. MIN_PULSE_TIME, MAX_PULSE_TIME
    Usually the range is between 500-2500, but it could be different

    For the PIN [BCM=18, BOARD=12] run the 02_configure_18.py
    For the PIN [BCM=8, BOARD=24] run the 01_configure_08.py

    Manually set a number between 500-2500 and see if the Servo moves from -90 to 90 degree.
    If you want shorter range, then you can find it out the right pulse time.
    Take a note about the min and max value, and use it in the next test/your own code

2. Test if the Servo moves through the range without jittering
    There is a big problem with the GPIO library. The Servo is jittering when you move it to the position.

    For the PIN [BCM=18, BOARD=12] run the 04_test_18.py
    For the PIN [BCM=8, BOARD=24] run the 03_test_08.py

    The code turns the Servo position from min till max position.
    Before you run, you need to configure the positions.
    By the default setting the 500 ms pulse time means -90 degree and the 2500 pulse time means 90 degree.
    (it means that the 1500 ms means 0 degree)
    If you nedd different angels then you have to make modification in the values.

3. Try out positioning the all structure at once.
    You already built in the servos into the board, the board is placed and fixed and everything is wired up.
    In the code - common_test.py - you have to define the camera positions: horizontal degree + vertical degree

    In the "position" dictionary the "key" is the identifier of the camera position, the "value" is a tuple where the first attribute is the horizontal, the second attribute is the vertical position
    for example: 

	position['2'] = (-90,0) 

    Meaning, the horizontal camera position is in the left side end position: -90 degree, the vertical camera position is right up: 0 degree.
    If you run the code, it will waiting for you to type the identifier. If you type an existing identifier, it will turn the camera accordingly.
